# Drug-Classification

This was one of the very first Machine Learning models I performed. it's a syntethic data set extracted from Kaggle. Based on some features, I had to predict if X patient had to take 'DrugY', 'drugC', 'drugX', 'drugA', oir 'drugB'.

Since most of the data was string, I had to transform it into a numeric value in order to fit the model.

Because it was a multiclassification model, I used a TreeClassifier algorythm, which performed an accuracy of 96.67%.
